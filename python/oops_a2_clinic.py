# Write a program to build a simple Clinic Management System using Python which
# can perform following operations inside the class CMS
# * Admit - This method takes patient details from the user like name,
#   gender, age, dob, blood group. A patient_id should be automatically generated
# * listPatients - This method displays the details of every patient.
# * search - searches for a particular patient using patient_id
# * Delete - deletes the record of a particular patient using patient_id
# * Update - will ask for the patient_id and other details. It will replace
#   the other details with new details.
# Create inherited classes 'OP' and 'NonOP'. 'OP' should have the additional
# Admit function and Non OP a function to generate an OP Ticket with 
# ncrementing no for every patient
